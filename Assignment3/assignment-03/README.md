# How my semester is going so far

So far my *semester* has been pretty rocky, but I'm trying to gain footing again. I enjoy the classes I have however! I'm not that apt to coding and my major isn't really rooted much in it, but I'm giving it a try! It's interesting and hard, but design is something I enjoy so I'm doing my best, even though I'm trying to catch up. I am eager to learn fundamentals in web design and site creation. The thing I think would help me the most in class is to give me a little time to catch up, I will be honest the lack of deadline notifications messed me up a bit.
