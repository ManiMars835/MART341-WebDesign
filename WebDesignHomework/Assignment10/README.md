Project Overview
What I worked on was all sites

Required Techniques
External CSS: Linked to index, contact and about for cleaner pages
Class Selector: For my banner, tips and tip list
ID Selector: Applied to make it so certain aspects like the number "6" stand out.
Background Colors: Chose colors behind tips to be different, as well as the footer. The colors chosen are pastel so it's legible with the text.
Font Colors: used a simple very dark red so it's not a harsh black, but it contrasts with the background so it's readable.
Positioning: Grid like layout that takes up a good portion but still leaves some white space on the outer edge and middle area. I also positioned the images to be a bit smaller so they don't take up too much space.
