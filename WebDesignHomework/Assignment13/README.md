Required Techniques (Must Have):
At Least 4 Pages – Drawing for beginners, Resources, about, contact

Responsive Design: I tested it within mobile and surprisingly it works wonders on there, I didn't need to change much.

Media Queries – The sources of media have been properly fitted to a 560px by 315px ratio and it fits on mobile well, same with the banner, it's fitted to the sites dimensions which translate well to mobile.

Navigation Menu – Simple and clear, allows for easy access.

Dropdown Menu – Added a dropdown menu to give access to all sites, rather than it be a bar of the pages on the top.
