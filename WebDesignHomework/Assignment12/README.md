I worked on my resources page some more, since I don't want to add too many pages.

1. Padding - There is already padding in my code, used it for the navigation buttons.
2. Border - Added a dashed border to my navigation buttons for a more concrete visual, and to draw the eye. Same with paragraphs so it wasn't floating.
3. Sizing - I've practically sized everything, from images to videos and gifs.
4. Inline - I believe this talks about inline elements, but inline elements inclue <img> and <a> and such like that, in which I've displayed in multiple places, like my titles having <span> and <style> paired with an <img>.
5. Margin - I have margins within my CSS that allow the tips to not be too big.
6. Overflow - Already have overflow within my CSS for the gif banner and tips.
