I think I want to further my blog like website for weird or odd stuff. I chose to go with this idea because it's more personable so I have a greater drive to create it. 
<br></br>
With the concepts used in this weeks lesson I created a lot more balance and flair to the site and it added a lot to it compared to when I initially started. I applied these concepts by centering the site for consistency and used tid bits like bold, italics and strikethroughs to add some personality to it.

Personally I didn't experience a whole lot of challenge, more so the challenge was to even figure out what to create to begin with, though I know publishing can be a pain to get it to work.

Finally with the state of how I'm doing, eehhhhh I won't lie, I'm not good at coding at all so I'm trying my best lol.
