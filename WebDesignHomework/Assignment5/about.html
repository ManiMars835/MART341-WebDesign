<h1>Why I chose these ideas</h1>

<h2>Portfolio</h2>
I'd like to look into making a portfolio website also! It's because art is a big passion of mine and I would love to be able to share that to people.

<h2>Cooking Site</h2>
I thought of making a cooking website! This is because I've always loved to cook and believe that I could help others by teaching them as well, since not everyone can cook. It would have basic beginner recipes to give people a start.

<h2>Blogsite</h2>
I'd like to do a blog site to just kind of have a chill relaxing site to express myself with. It wouldn't be anything too serious, it would be a nice side project site.
