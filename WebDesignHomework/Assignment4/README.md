Question: Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?

Answer: A browser is a type of software that allows users to view content from a server. It does this with a layout and interface in order to properly place and display the functions of the site, while behind the scenes there is a programming language used so the content on the site has instruction and reason for looking a certain way or saying a certain thing.


Question: HTML, XML, XHTMLâ€”what sets them apart?
Answers: 

HTML - This is the most common markup langauge out of the 3. It's usually used to render structure and content on a page, being a standard for page creation. The issues with it is it has constant updates to it and it might have issues across browser types.

XML - XML is a markup langauge mostly used for documents and sharing those documents. The pros to this is it takes very little data in order to send or recieve documents, it has easy upgrades without ruining any intergrity of the data and it's more accessible for data transfer. The cons to this is XML isn't able to actually render anything besides documents and tags, and with these tags it takes time to customize them.

XHTML - XHTML is essentially the combination of both HTML and XML in order to create a better markup language that makes up for the cons of the other 2. This allows the language and site to have a more stable structure that won't be distrupted by updates, it allows for better handling on documents and trasnferance. The cons with this is since it's a more complicated language it takes longer to markup, it isn't usable on lower resource devices like phones, and the standards for XHTML are more complicated overall.
