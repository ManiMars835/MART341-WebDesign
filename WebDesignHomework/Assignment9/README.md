Please share why you chose this topic and what excites you about it.
I chose drawing because it’s one of my favorite things ever. I’ve been drawing for a long while now and I’d like to share that knowledge with others since anyone can draw if they learn!
How will you incorporate movement and rhythm into your instructable page?
I’d incorporate the drop down menu to have a nice smooth movement. Along with that I’ll make it so when you scroll the images and description slide into frame with a smooth animation and a fade in. I could make it so the gallery of images is a scrolling horizontal banner towards the bottom.

This was my initial plan, though I changed it to 6 steps, and removed some of the unnecessary assets, I did what I could and I belive I did an alright job!
